What I learned from image classification project:

1. Load data set using TensorFlow, which automatically detects file size and amount of classes.
2. Each image has following dimensions:
    (height, width, channel for colors)
    Where 3 = RGB and 1 = grayscale
3. TensorFlow then seperates the data into batches depending on number of training examples.
4. Then scale the dataset for values between 0 and 1.
5. You then split data using .skip and .take methods.
6. TensorFlow automatically sets batch size to 32, and rescales image to (256, 256).
7. You can store the history and record the loss functions.
